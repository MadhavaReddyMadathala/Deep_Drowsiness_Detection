## 📖 Overview

This repository contains a deep learning model to detect drowsiness in drivers using **webcam feed** or pre-recorded videos. The system alerts users with an audible alarm 🚨 when signs of drowsiness (like closed eyes or yawning) are detected. Perfect for enhancing road safety! 🚦👨✈️

### Key Features 🌟
- **Real-time detection** using YOLO for high-speed inference 🚀
- **Webcam integration** for live monitoring 📸
- **Audible alarm system** to alert drowsy drivers 🔔
- Lightweight and efficient model powered by **PyTorch** 🔥
- Configurable confidence thresholds and alarm settings ⚙️
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Linux/macOS) 💻🖥️
